This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript closure issue encountered when using setTimeout within a loop. The code in `bug.js` showcases the problem, where all iterations of the loop output the final value of `i` instead of the value at each iteration. The solution in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to correctly capture the value of `i` using an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE).
